# .vim
 My own pathogen setting for cloning.

## How to install
 As shown below (In the $HOME (by :echo $HOME):

1) On Windows: 

 	git clone  --recursive https://github.com/utylee/.vim vimfiles 

2) On Linux:

 	git clone  --recursive https://github.com/utylee/.vim .vim


 After that, copy .vimrc.copyto $HOME/.vimrc    
Have fun!!
